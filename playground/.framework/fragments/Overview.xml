                This project began as an experiment to create a modern, component-based web application framework.
                My first attempt was called **chisel**, which was an early exploration of ideas around reusable components,
                declarative rendering, and lightweight state management.
                While **chisel** introduced some of these concepts, it did not progress very far in development and remained a minimal, proof-of-concept framework.
            </p>

            Building on the lessons learned from **chisel**, I started a new framework called **html-next**.
            This was a fresh take on the same core ideas, but with a different approach and a more robust architecture.
            **html-next** has made it much further along in development, offering a richer set of features, better performance, and a more flexible component model.
            The framework now serves as the foundation for this project, enabling rapid prototyping and a more maintainable codebase.


            You can find the **html-next** codebase here:
            <a href="https://github.com/crosshj/html-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">html-next on GitHub</a>

            If you are browsing the codebase, you may still encounter remnants of **chisel** in various places.
            These are kept intentionally for documentation purposes and to illustrate the evolution of the project.
            The process is documented in the project README, and further details can be found in the code comments and commit history.
            For developers interested in the technical details of the evolution, a comparison of key architectural decisions and code samples is available upon request.
            You can also see the original state of chisel at this commit:
            <a href="https://github.com/fiugd/welcome/tree/e0255a8acad9ffb5fb729b19bcbe3bc584d192df/playground/.framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old School Chisel</a>

            While both frameworks were created to simplify web development, **chisel** was intentionally minimal and experimental,
            offering only the core essentials for building UIs.
            **html-next** is a more comprehensive evolution, supporting advanced features like server-side rendering, dynamic imports,
            a rich plugin architecture, and better support for accessibility, internationalization, and theming.
            The move to **html-next** allowed me to realize the original vision with a more complete and production-ready toolset.

            The transition from **chisel** to **html-next** was a natural progression.
            I reviewed the ideas and code from **chisel**, taking what worked and rethinking what could be improved.
            Some concepts and utilities were carried over, while others were replaced or reimagined to fit the new architecture.
            References to **chisel** remain in the codebase (such as in the modules folder and commented code in the main index.html script) as a record of the project's evolution.

            <x-separator></x-separator>

            Today, the project is fully powered by **html-next** within the `.framework` folder.
            This has resulted in easier maintenance, faster development cycles, and access to a wider range of features.
            **html-next** now serves as the foundation for all UI and component logic, enabling rapid prototyping and robust application architecture.
            Looking ahead, I plan to further explore **html-next**'s advanced capabilities, such as custom directives, animation hooks, and integration with third-party libraries.
            There are also plans to share custom components and utilities developed during this process.

            Building and maintaining both **chisel** and **html-next** has been a valuable learning experience,
            providing deep insights into the inner workings of modern web frameworks.
            The evolution from **chisel** to **html-next** highlights the benefits of iterating on ideas and refining approaches over time.
            This process not only accelerated development but also ensured that the project remains aligned with modern standards and best practices.

            The journey from **chisel** to **html-next** is a personal story of learning, iteration, and growth as a developer.
            By building on past attempts and refining ideas, this project is well-positioned to take advantage of the latest advancements in web technology while maintaining a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebasnte.
