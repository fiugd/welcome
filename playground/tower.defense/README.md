I'm making a game and starting with Line Rangers style.

## What I like about LR:

-   visuals (except would prefer less cute)
-   gameplay

## What I dislike about LR:

-   money-grabbing
-   disconnected from community/players
-   gacha that feels unfair

## notes

from lerico, characters seem to be under 200x200 with many around 170 high and
varying widths 760x428 game dims from a screencap I saw, seems reasonable

heights zoomed in total - 400/1400(28.5%) (above tower) + 650/1400(46.4%)
(tower - including shadow of 50px) + 350/1400(25%) (below tower) horizon line at
800/1400 from top character - about 350/1400 (25%)

new res 800 x 4000 tower top - 229px from top tower - 371px (with 28px shadow)
tower bottom - 600px from top

character - 200px

the dry bones sprite sheet gets me thinking it would be nice to make a bones
