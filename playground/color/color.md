## todo:
- add some visuals that show color spaces and how they overlap with each other perceptual color
- I read an ariticle about a new color space, find that and add it here

## topics that interest me:
- geometric distance between colors, color similarity
- color space versus perceptual color
- smooth transition between colors

## parsing
> while parsing css colors is not my main interest, it is cool so check it out if you'd like
